# A Webpage About Me

This is a website I created with the help of using a template from orson.io

The python web server in flask is not my code

I borrowed it from https://github.com/aneagoie/portfo-updated/blob/main/server.py

Sample website! Since this uses Flask v3>, to run the server command:

The old call command:
```
$ export FLASK_APP=<filename>
$ flask run
```

Flask is currently on version 3.0, so the command is now:
```
$ flask --app <filename> run
```

NOTE: add `--debug` to the end to run in debug mode.
