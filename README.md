# A Webpage About Me

This is a website I created with the help of using a template from https://en.orson.io and then I edited it with my info

The python web server in flask is not my code

I borrowed it from https://github.com/aneagoie/portfo-updated/blob/main/server.py

Download repo and setup a python venv to run

```
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

$ flask --app server.py run
```
Then visit 127.0.0.1:5000 to see the webpage

I plan to host this website using the cloud. Either an S3 bucket or https://www.pythonanywhere.com
